[Issue #141](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/141) for details.

See the published [API Documentation](/api/2.0-M2/).

List of changes:
 
- [Issue #88](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/88): the `Task` implementation
  has been redesigned from scratch
- [Issue #89](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/89): Cats integration 
  has been tried and yielded very positive results, but is being delayed 
- [Issue #96](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/96) 
  and [issue 99](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/99): add `MulticastStrategy` for
  safer building of multicast Observables
- [Issue #127](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/127):
  Introduce operators onErrorHandle and onErrorHandleWith
- [Issue #128](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/128): operators 
  materialize, dematerialize and memoize for `Task` (and `Coeval`)
- [Issue #113](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/113): Introduce the `bufferIntrospective`
  operator
- [Issue #123](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/123): underlying protocol 
  changes, did some fixes for the work that already happened for `M1`
- [Issue #131](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/131): renamed `Ack.Cancel`
  to `Ack.Stop` in order to differentiate it as a verb from `Cancelable.cancel`,
  because in version `2.0` they are two different actions 
  (and it's more semantically correct this way)
- [Issue #132](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/132): introduced the
   `Observable.onCancelTriggerError` operator
- [Issue #133](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/133): introduced the
   `Observable.doOnDownstreamStop` and `doOnCancel` 
   (which is one reason for #131)
- [Issue #134](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/134): 
   New operator `Observable.switchIfEmpty`
- [Issue #136](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/136): 
   Clarify reactive streams, initiated `monix.execution.rstreams` for 
   reusable subscription types and added the `ReactivePublisher` type-class
   for things that can be converted to `org.reactivestreams.Publisher`
   (both Observable and Task are instances)
- [Issue #140](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/140): 
   Add type-class hierarchy, to be integrated with both Cats and Scalaz
- [Issue #141](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/141): reimplement Task 
  from scratch, introduce Coeval, introduce Scheduler.executionModel

Enjoy!
