## Issues

Bug fixes:

- [Issue #468](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/468):
  Observables created using `concat` don't get canceled
  (**critical**)
- [Issue #483](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/483):
  stack overflow error on `MVar.put`
- [Issue #541](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/541):
  `observable.take(0)` shouldn't subscribe to the source at all
- [Issue #475](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/475):
  `Observable.fromAsyncStateAction` does not protect against
  exceptions thrown in use code

Issue `#468` in particular is pretty serious as it can lead to
resource leaks. Read the [pull request](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/469)
for more details.

## Upgrading

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt` (and use
`%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.3.3"
```
