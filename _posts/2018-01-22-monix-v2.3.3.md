---

Release is binary backwards compatible with series `2.3.x`.

Bug fixes:

- [Issue #468](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/468):
  Observables created using `concat` don't get canceled
  (**critical**)
- [Issue #483](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/483):
  stack overflow error on `MVar.put`
- [Issue #541](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/541):
  `observable.take(0)` shouldn't subscribe to the source at all
- [Issue #475](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/475):
  `Observable.fromAsyncStateAction` does not protect against
  exceptions thrown in use code

Issue `#468` in particular is pretty serious as it can lead to
resource leaks. Read the [pull request](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/469)
for more details.

Upgrade to `2.3.3` is recommended!

A release for the `3.0.0-Mx` series will follow either today or tomorrow.
