description: Another release candidate, lots of Observable operators added, breaking changes!
---

The sixth release candidate, simplifies the [Cats](http://typelevel.org/) integration,
introduces an alternative parallel `Applicative` instance for `Task`,
changes the `Observable.buffer` operators to match the behavior in ReactiveX,
adds observable builders from `java.io.InputStream` and `Reader`,
adds `Observable.executeOn`, along with other utils and refactors the 
`Pipe` and `ConcurrentSubject` builders. Also contains bug fixes.

See the published [API Documentation](/api/2.0-RC6/).

**Breaking changes:**

- [Issue #157](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/157): Renaming 
  `Observable.doOnCancel` to `doOnSubscriptionCancel`
  because its meaning has changed since Monifu 1.x and it will cause pain
- [Issue #160](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/160) (**breaking change**): 
  Revamp the buffer operators on `Observable`
- [Issue #161](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/161) (**breaking change**):
  Revamp the ConcurrentSubject and Pipe constructors

Bug fixes and enhancements:

- [Bug #153](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/153): already fixed in 
   `2.0-RC5` for `Task`, but now also fixed for `Coeval`
- [Issue #155](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/155): Coeval enhancements 
   and fixes
- [Issue #156](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/156): Adding `Observable.doOnTerminate`
  for executing a piece of logic when `onComplete` or `onError` happens, or
  when the subscriber stops the streaming with `Stop`
- [Issue #158](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/158): `Observable.fromIterator`
  takes now an optional `onFinish` callback for resource deallocation, because
  the `Iterator` interface doesn't provide a `close()` that could be used
- [Issue #163](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/163): added 
  `Observable.fromInputStream`, `fromCharsReader` and `fromLinesReader` for
  reading from `java.io.InputStream`, `java.io.Reader` and `java.io.BufferedReader`
  data sources
- [Issue #164](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/164): Add 
  `Observable.executeOn`, as alternative to `observeOn`
- [Issue #165](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/165): Simplification
  of the Cats integration
  
Enjoy!
