This release is binary compatible with 2.0.x, being a maintenance.
In order to upgrade, just increment the version number in `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.0.6"
```

This version is published for **Scala 2.12.0 final release**, incrementing
the dependency on Minitest to 0.27 and on Scalaz to 7.2.7.
