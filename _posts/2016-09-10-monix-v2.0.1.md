description: Upgrades Cats, Scalaz and Scala 2.12 to latest versions
---

This release is binary compatible with 2.0.0, being just a maintenance
release that upgrades Cats to version `0.7.2`, Scalaz to `7.2.6` and
Scala to `2.12.0-RC1`.

The upgrade isn't necessary, unless you're using `monix-cats` and are
affected by [Cats #1346](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1346).
