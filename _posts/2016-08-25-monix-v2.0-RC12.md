description: Task is probably the most performant implementation around.
---

This version fixes `Task.memoize` and `Coeval.memoize`, while
introducing even more and quite significant `Task` optimizations.
More details on performance to follow.

See the published [API Documentation](/api/2.0-RC12/).

Bug fixes:

- [Issue #211](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/211):
  `CompositeCancelable.remove` wasn't working after the changes in
  RC10, fixed it in RC11 and now added some more tests
- [Issue #213](https://github.com/monixio/monix/pull/213): Fixes
  `Task` / `Coeval` memoize operation

Enhancements:

- [Issue #212](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/212): Upgraded
  Cats to version 0.7.0
- [PR #214](https://github.com/monixio/monix/pull/214): optimize Task,
  refactorings, some deprecations (details below)

Details on [PR #214](https://github.com/monixio/monix/pull/214):

- Upgraded the Cats dependency to version 0.7.0. Had some trouble with
  that (see
  [cats#1329](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1329)), but it
  is now functional
- Renamed `eval` to `evalAlways` across the board (in `Task`, `Coeval`
  and `Observable`), but kept `evalAlways` with the `@deprecated`
  sign, so upgrade should be smooth. The reason is that `evalAlways`
  is an often used operation and deserves a shorter name  
- For Scalaz converts introduced `Task.delay` as an alias of
  `Task.eval`, `Task.suspend` as an alias of `Task.defer` and
  `Task.async` as an alias of `Task.create`
- Renamed `Task.eval(Coeval)` to `Task.coeval(Coeval)` and
  `Observable.eval(Coeval)` to `Observable.coeval(Coeval)` in order to
  avoid a conflict
- Refactor the `Task` internals again, for optimizations and simplifications:  
  - Simplified the internal states, e.g. instead of having `Now`,
    `Error`, `Always` and `Once`, we now have a single
    `Delay(coeval)`, thus reusing the `Coeval` type for computing
    asynchronous values  
  - Get rid of the `Task.Attempt` type, it never made any sense that
    one. People can use `Coeval.Attempt` if they need a `Try`
    alternative (and convert to `Task` if they end up needing a
    `Task`)
  - Introduced `Scheduler.executeAsync` and `Scheduler.executeLocal`
    as extension methods powered by macros, for zero-overhead, because
    building `Runnable` instances is too annoying
  - Used `Scheduler.executeLocal` and `LocalRunnable` in key points in
    the `Task` implementation to reduce forking    
  - Made `Task.gather` be based on `Task.gatherUnordered` and it is
    now way faster
- Moved everything from `monix.types.shims` to `monix.types`

Enjoy!
