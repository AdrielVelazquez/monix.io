description: Adds an awesome Consumer type, Observable.interleave, introduces Coeval params in operators
---

This release candidate is probably the last one before `2.0`, assuming
new bugs aren't found. Amongst others, it introduces an awesome
`Consumer` type which makes it possible to describe composable
consumers. For a teaser:

```scala
// For processing sums in parallel, useless of course, but can become 
// really helpful for logic sprinkled with I/O bound stuff
val consumer = Consumer
  .loadBalance(parallelism=10, Consumer.foldLeft(Coeval(0L))(_ + _))
  .map(_.sum)

val observable: Observable[Int] = ???
// Our consumer turns our observable into a Task processing sums, w00t!
val task: Task[Long] = observable.runWith(consumer)

// Consume the whole stream and get the result
task.runAsync.foreach(println)
```

**Critical bug fix:**

- [BUG #181](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/181): the default operators
  on `CancelableFuture` are triggering `StackOverflow` exceptions
  
New Features:

- [Issue #184](https://github.com/monixio/monix/pull/184): introducing the
  `Consumer` type, a factory of subscribers that makes it easier to specify 
  reusable and composable consumers and for example, it makes it possible, 
  out of the box, to load-balance the workload between multiple subscribers in
  parallel; see the description
- [Issue #186](https://github.com/monixio/monix/pull/186) (related to 
  [issue #168](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/168)): adds the 
  `Observable.interleave2` operator, similar with the one in `FS2` 
  (former scalaz-streams)
- [Issue #180](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/180): the `Observer.feed`
  function now has an overload that does not take a cancelable, because
  it's awkward coming up with one if it isn't needed; there's also a 
  `onNextAll` extension for both `Observer` and `Subscriber` which can push
  a whole collection of events
- [Issue #187](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/187): integrates
  the `MonadCombine` type-class from [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/),
  being similar to the Scalaz `MonadPlus`, as somehow this was missed in 
  the initial integration
- [Issue #177](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/177) reviews exposed
  traits and abstract classes, making sure they inherit from `Serializable` 
- [Issue #85](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/85): small change,  
  clarifies the ScalaDoc on the `RefCountCancelable` type
- [Issue #162](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/162): implements
  the `Observable.takeUntil(trigger: Observable[Any])` operator, an operator
  that takes from the source until another observable triggers an event
- [Issue #189](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/189): for `Observable`
  operators that return a single item (e.g. `sumF`, `foldLeftF`, etc.) adds
  variants that do the same thing, but return `Task` results instead, so now
  we have `foldLeftL`, `sumL`, etc. that return tasks
- [Issue #190](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/190): changes many 
  observable operators, that were taking by-name parameters or initial state
  parameters (e.g. `headOrElseF`, `foldLeftF`, etc), to take `Coeval` params
  instead, in order to have fine control over the evaluation model
- [Issue #191](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/191): introduces 
  by default an implicit conversion from `Any` to `Coeval.Now`, to make it 
  easier to use `Coeval` as function parameters - the default will thus 
  simply be strict evaluation, strictness being usually the default in Scala

This release we've got a new contributor: 
[@leakyabstraction](https://github.com/leakyabstraction); W00t!

Enjoy!
