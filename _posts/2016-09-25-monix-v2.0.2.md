This release is binary compatible with 2.0.x, being a bug fix release
release:

- [Bug #224](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/224):
  `IllegalStateException` logged in parallel consumer, when streaming
  gets canceled due to a subscriber triggering an error
  
This bug if basically harmless, it's only effect being to log
unnecessary `IllegalStateExceptions` by means of
`Scheduler.reportError`.

Enjoy!
