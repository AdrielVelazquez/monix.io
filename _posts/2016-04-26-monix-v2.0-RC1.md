Feature freeze. There's lots of interesting stuff to work on, but 
we should strive for stable 2.0 release first. It's going to be
mostly bug fixing from here until the final 2.0, no more design
work.

See the published [API Documentation](/api/2.0-RC1/).

This means that some plans were dropped temporarily, like
integration with Cats and Scalaz.

Changes:

- [Bug #143](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/143): on 
  RefCountObservable cancel and stop should be idempotent

Enjoy!
