description: Task optimizations, bug fixes, zipWith rename
---

This release fixes one issue with `Task`, as it was discovered that
`flatMap` loops aren't automatically cancelable, a small
oversight. Also `CompositeCancelable.remove` wasn't working, a bug
introduced in the previous release. Another bug that was fixed is in
`Consumer.foldLeftAsync`, which wasn't capturing errors properly.

This release introduces a major refactoring of the `Task` internal
workings of its trampoline, as a serious optimization. As an example
of what this brings, the conversion from a `Future` with
`Task.fromFuture` has near-zero overhead and the performance of
`Task.gather` and `Task.gatherUnordered` has improved significantly.

There are also breaking API changes, sorry about that, but these
should come sooner rather than later, before marking 2.0 final. The
`zipWith` (e.g. `zipWith2`, `zipWith3`) operators on `Task` and
`Observable` and the `combineLatestWith` operators on `Observable`
have been renamed to `zipMap` (e.g. `zipMap2`, etc) and
`combineLatestMap` respectively. This because `zipMap` describes the
operation much better and this name has also been used in the
Typelevel Cats / Dogs libraries at least.

Bug fixes:

- [Issue #207](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/207): Task
  flatMap loop isn't cancelable  
- [Issue #210](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/210): Fixed
  `CompositeCancelable.remove`, a bug introduced in the last release
  (RC10)

Enhancements:

- [Issue #208](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/208): Uniquely
  name threads generated from ThreadFactory
- [Issue #210](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/210): Refactorings
  for performance and coherence reasons, described below

Issue #210 changes for the `monix-execution` sub-project:

- introduced the `CallbackRunnable` interface for marking `Runnable`
  instances that could be executed on the current thread, on a local
  trampoline, as an optimization
- introduced `LocalBatchingExecutor`, a mixin for schedulers that can
  execute `CallbackRunnable` locally, using a trampoline
- made `AsyncScheduler` for the JVM be able to execute
  `CallbackRunnable` instances by inheriting from
  `LocalBatchingExecutor`; but not on top of Javascript
- fixed critical bug in `CompositeCancelable` that was introduced in
  the last release

Issue #210 changes for the `monix-eval` sub-project:

- optimized `Task.fromFuture` to the point that it has near zero
  overhead

- optimized `Task.gather`, `Task.gatherUnordered`, `Task.sequence`
- `Task.gather` now forces asynchronous execution for the given tasks
- `Task.gatherUnordered` also forces asynchronous execution
- optimized the `Task` trampoline in general
- introduced `Callback.async` wrapper and `asyncApply` extension
  method
- renamed `Task.zipWith` to `Task.zipMap` (rename across the board,
  also for `Observable`)
- added `Task.executeOn` for overriding the `Scheduler`
- added `Task.fork` overload with a scheduler override
- added `Task.async` as an alias of `Task.create`

Issue #210 changes for the `monix-types` sub-project:

- moved all shims to `monix.types.shims`, in order to differentiate
  them from type-classes that are not shims  
- added the `Deferrable` type-class, to express lazy evaluation
  concerns (e.g. `evalOnce`, `evalAlways`, `defer`, `memoize`)
- added the `Evaluable` type-class, for computations that will
  eventually produce a value

Issue #210 changes for the `monix-reactive` project:

- for `foldLeft` methods, make the seed be just a normal
  by-name parameter instead of a `Coeval`, because otherwise
  it isn't compatible with other type-classes / interfaces
- affected methods are `foldLeft`, `foldLeftAsync`
- rename `zipWith` to `zipMap`
- rename `combineLatestWith` to `combineLatestMap`
- add `Observable.fromAsyncStateAction`
- fix `Consumer.foldLeftAsync`
