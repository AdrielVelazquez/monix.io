Bug fix release, fixing a critical issue.

All users are advised to upgrade right away (if on `RC4`).

## Changes

- **[#991](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/991) ([PR #993](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/993))**: `NullPointerException` in `Task` when used in combination with `Local`
- [#992](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/992) ([PR #998](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/998)): hide `InterceptableRunnable` exposed accidentally, refactor it for efficiency
- [#997](https://github.com/monix/monix/pull/997): bumped Scala version to 2.12.9 and Scala.js to 0.6.28

## Upgrading

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "3.0.0-RC5"
```

## Binary compatibility

This release is binary compatible with `3.0.0-RC4` and `3.0.0-RC3`.

With the only issue that a class in `monix.execution.internal` was accidentally exposed as public — classes in `internal` packages are internal, should never be used, so this class is now gone:

```scala
// Internals — accidentally exposed
exclude[MissingClassProblem]("monix.execution.internal.InterceptableRunnable$Wrapped"),
exclude[MissingClassProblem]("monix.execution.internal.InterceptableRunnable$Delegate"),
exclude[MissingClassProblem]("monix.execution.internal.InterceptableRunnable$"),
exclude[MissingClassProblem]("monix.execution.internal.InterceptableRunnable")
```

This should not have an impact on any projects, but is good to know.
