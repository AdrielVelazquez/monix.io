description: Third release candidate, bug fixing, we're getting close to final ó‿ó
---

The third release candidate, fixes an issue with `BehaviorSubject`
and `ReplaySubject`, making them release subscribers that stopped
the stream while connecting, allowing them to be garbage collected
faster. This is a very common use-case.

See the published [API Documentation](/api/2.0-RC3/).

Changes:

- [Issue #147](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/147) - Make `BehaviorSubject` and `ReplaySubject` 
  remove subscribers that triggered `Stop` while connecting, thus freeing
  the memory sooner, otherwise the GC cannot free the subscriber because
  its reference is kept captive until the next `Subject.onNext`
- Remove `tut` and `site` from `project/plugins`, as the documentation will
  be handled in the [monix.io](https://github.com/monixio/monix.io) repository
- Re-enable code coverage in Travis and fix the build to actually test Scala 2.10.6
