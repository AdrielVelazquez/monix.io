Version `2.2.4` is out now.

It is a minor release that's binary and source compatible with
`2.2.x`, fixing a bugs and upgrading Scala.js:

- [Bug #338](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/328):
  Fix broken test that can yield errors in Scala's community build
- [Bug #333](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/333):
  `Observable.firstStartedOf` fails due to off-by-one error
- [Bug #335](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/335):
  Observable `concatMap` / `mapTask` trigger invalid state warning
  on `raiseError` children

Changes:

- [Issue #334](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/334):
  Add `CompositeCancelable.getAndResetTo`, needed for the new
  `firstStartedOf` implementation
- Upgrade Scala.js to latest version `0.6.15`, handing deprecation
  warnings in `TaskApp`

Upgrade should be safe, being binary compatible with all previous
`2.2.x` versions.

### Upgrading

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt` (and use
`%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.2.4"
```

The other projects from the [@Monix](https://github.com/monix) organization
have also been upgraded to depend on this new version.

**[shade](https://github.com/monix/shade)**, the Scala Memcached client:

```scala
dependencies += "io.monix" %% "shade" % "1.9.4"
```

**[monix-kafka](https://github.com/monix/monix-kafka)**, the Apache Kafka
integration:

```scala
// For Kafka 8
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-8" % "0.13"

// For Kafka 9
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-9" % "0.13"

// For Kafka 10
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-10" % "0.13"
```

Enjoy!
