description: Bug fix for Observable.bufferSliding, upgrade to Scala 2.12.1
---

Greetings,

Version `2.1.2` is out now.

It is a minor release, binary compatible with `2.1.x`,
upgrading Scala to `2.12.1` and fixing a bug in `Observable.bufferSliding`.
See [Bug #275](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/275).

<!--more-->

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt` (and use
`%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.1.2"
```

The other projects from the [@Monix](https://github.com/monix) organization 
have also been upgraded to depend on this new version.

**[shade](https://github.com/monix/shade)**, the Scala Memcached client:

```scala
dependencies += "io.monix" %% "shade" % "1.8.1"
```

**[monix-kafka](https://github.com/monix/monix-kafka)**, the Apache Kafka 
integration:

```scala
// For Kafka 8
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-8" % "0.8"

// For Kafka 9
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-9" % "0.8"

// For Kafka 10
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-10" % "0.8"
```

Enjoy!
