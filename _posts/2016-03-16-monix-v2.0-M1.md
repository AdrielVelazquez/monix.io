  tutorials type-checked as part of the test process

  with [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats)
- [Issue #90](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/90) - remove functionality that isn't

- [Issue #91](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/91) - project rename and reorganization (epic API breakage)
- [Issue #93](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/93) - renamed `Observable.onSubscribe` to
  `Observable.unsafeSubscribeFn`, because it shouldn't be used directly, unless you really, really
  know what you're doing
- [Issue #94](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/94) - fixed comments style to ScalaDoc
- [Issue #96](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/96) - removed `Observable.create` because
  it is unsafe
- [Issue #100](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/100) - enhanced the `Scheduler` interface
- [Issue #102](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/102) - brought back `sun.misc.Unsafe` 
  (actually this was done in separate project, as part of [issue #104](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/104))
- [Issue #104](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/104) - separated the `Atomic` implementations
  in the [Sincron](https://github.com/monixio/sincron)
- [Issue #106](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/106) - enabled code coverage reports
- [Issue #111](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/111) - improved test coverage
- [Issue #114](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/114) - initiated the `benchmarks` sub-project to
  track performance issues
- [Issue #115](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/115) - `Cancelable.cancel` now returns `Unit`
  and not `Boolean`
- [Issue #118](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/118) - Fix `materialize`, add `dematerialize`
- [Issue #119](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/119) - Introduced `Pipe`, 
  renamed `Channel` in `ConcurrentSubject`, renamed `SynchronousObserver` in `SyncObserver`,
  renamed `SynchronousSubscriber` in `SyncSubscriber`
- [Issue #121](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/121) - Clarified the contract for synchronous
  pipelines, got rid of the hacks from `internal`, replacing them with macro-driven extensions
  for `Future[Ack]`
- [Issue #123](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/123) - Changed the protocol of `Observable.subscribe`,
  back-pressuring `onComplete` and `onError` is now optional and `Observable.unsafeSubscribeFn` needs
  to return a usable `Cancelable` instead of `Unit` (big internal change)
- [Issue #125](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/125) - Modified contract of 
  `AsyncScheduler`, added a new `ExecutorScheduler`

Enjoy!
