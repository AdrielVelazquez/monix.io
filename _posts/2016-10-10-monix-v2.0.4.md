description: Fixes an issue with AsyncScheduler
---

This release is binary compatible with 2.0.x, being a bug fix release
release for [Issue #244](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/244):
`AsyncScheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate` and `scheduleWithFixedDelay` on the JVM
have incorrect behavior.

<!--more-->

The `AsyncScheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate` method implementation has
incorrect behavior and this includes `monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global`.
Sample:

```scala
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit
monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

global.scheduleAtFixedRate(1, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS, runnable)

global.scheduleWithFixedDelay(1, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS, runnable)
```

What happens is that if the given `runnable` takes more than 2 seconds to
execute, then concurrent tasks are going to be executed. This happens
because this periodic scheduling is deferred to the global
`Scheduler.DefaultScheduledExecutor` instance, a single threaded Java
`ScheduledExecutor` that then defers the actual execution of the task to the
`ForkJoinPool` in charge of the actual execution. But by doing this deferring,
the time it takes that runnable to execute is not taken into account at all.
This behavior is inconsistent with how these operations work for Java's
`ScheduledExecutor` and with how they are documented in ScalaDoc.

NOTE: this behavior does not manifest itself for `ExecutorScheduler`
(e.g. `Scheduler.io`, `Scheduler.fixedPool`, `Scheduler.singleThread`)
or any of the 2 available scheduler implementations for Javascript.

The fix involves the `AsyncScheduler` implementation to piggy-back on the
implementation in `ReferenceScheduler`, just like the Javascript scheduler
implementations.

Cheers,
