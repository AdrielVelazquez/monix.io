description: Scheduler, Task and OverflowStrategy enhancements
---

This release adds some useful extension methods for `Scheduler` and
`Callback`, while optimizing and making safer some `Task` operations, like
`gatherUnordered`, 'chooseFirstOfList' and `create`. On `Observable` it
also changes how `onOverflow` behaves when specified in an `OverflowStrategy`.
This will be a breaking, but easy to fix change.

Release RC10 is the last release before 2.0, scheduled for September 1st
(promise, cross my heart and hope to ...).

**BUG WARNING:** this release contains a critical bug issue.
Upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible.

See the published [API Documentation](/api/2.0-RC10/).

Issues:

- [Issue #200](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/200): Add an
  `executeNow` extension method for `Scheduler`, taking a by-name callback,
  as initializing `Runnable` instances is too annoying
- [Issue #201](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/201): Fixes and
  optimizes `Task.gatherUnordered` - as an edge-case, it wasn't stack
  safe and it has been optimized to be more efficient
- [Issue #202](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/202): Added
  `asyncOnSuccess` and `asyncOnError` as extension methods for `Callback`
  and made `Task.create` safe by forcing an asynchronous boundary when
  calling the callback (onSuccess/onError); also optimizes
  `Task.chooseFirstOfList` and `TestScheduler`
- [Issue #203](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/203): Changed
  the `onOverflow` function signature for `OverflowStrategy` types
  supporting it - it can now return an `Option` and if it returns
  `None`, then we don't signal any messages downstream, thus making
  it easier to just log that overflow happened without extra tricks

Enjoy!
