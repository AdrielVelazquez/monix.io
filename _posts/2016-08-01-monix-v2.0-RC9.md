description: Bug fixes, generalized Task's sequence, gather and gatherUnordered
---

This release fixes a bug in `Task.mapBoth` and thus the operations
depending on it, like `Task.gather`. It also fixes another bug in
the Cats `Applicative` instance for `Task`, adding a required overload
for running Tasks in parallel when using the applicative builder.

This release also changes the signatures of Task's `sequence`, `gather` and
`gatherUnordered` to use the `CanBuildFrom` pattern, a contribution
by [@guersam](https://github.com/guersam).
