description: Fifth RC release, Cats integration, enhancements to Task, bug fixes!
---

The fifth release candidate, re-introduces the
[Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/) integration, introduces new `Task`
operators `doOnFinish`, `gather` and `gatherUnordered` and changes
the behavior of `Task.sequence`. Also contains a critical bug fix.

See the published [API Documentation](/api/2.0-RC5/).

Changes:

- [Issue #89](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/149) - reintroducing a minimal 
  Cats integration, along with tests based on `cats-laws`. We are splitting `monix.type` 
  into its own sub-project and `monix-cats` depends on it. This ensures that the pick what
  you use approach also works with `monix-cats`, as people wanting just `Task` should not
  get `Observable`, yet `Observable` needs integration as well.
- [Issue #149](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/149) - documentation related fixes
  - Improved the description of `Task`
  - `Task.unit` is now a final val
  - `Task.never` now shares the reference instead of building a new instance every time
  - Exposing `Task.unsafeStartNow` and `Task.unsafeStartAsync`, as otherwise `Task.unsafeCreate` 
    is useless. So we should expose all of them, or none at all.
  - `FutureUtils.Extensions.dematerialize` was named "materialize" (WTF!) and is renamed
  - Task should inherit just from `Serializable` and not from `Product`
- [Issue #150](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/150) - add a new `Task.doOnFinish` 
  operator that executes once a task is finished.
- [Issue #151](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/151) - changing `Future.sequence` to be 
  ordered in both execution and effects
- [Issue #152](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/152) - introduce `Task.gather` which 
  behaves like the previous `sequence` and `Task.gatherUnordered` which doesn't do ordering
  for results either.
- [Bug 153](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/153) - Task.sequence and Task.gather 
  return a shared mutable.ListBuffer

Enjoy!
